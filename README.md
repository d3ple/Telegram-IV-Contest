# Telegram IV Contest

My repository for [Telegram Instant View templates competition](https://instantview.telegram.org/contest)

> Instant View allows Telegram users to view articles from around the Web in a consistent way, with zero loading time.

> Templates are sets of instructions that allow Telegram servers to process articles from anywhere on the internet into uniform and lightweight Instant View pages to be displayed to users.
